Use with SLX FPGA
=================

`SLX FPGA`_ is a tool designed to accelerate HLS design flows.
It tackles the challenges associated with the HLS design flow including
non-synthesizable C/C++ code, non-hardware aware C/C++ code, detecting
application parallelism, and where and how to insert pragmas.
The figure below gives an overview of the SLX FPGA workflow for implementation
and optimization of an HLS application, starting with a C\C++ specification.

   `SLX FPGA`_: automated workflow for HLS

SLX FPGA performs dynamic analysis to extract deep insight into the behavior
of the code. Its analysis capabilities are then able to provide several
perspectives on the code which can be especially useful when trying to
understand performance blockers.
It analyzes parallelism in the code as well as memory consumption and memory
accesses. It can evaluate the impact of each section of code on the performance
of the overall program execution.
This makes it easier for designers to determine if and where the code needs
refactoring. The tool then takes this one very important step further and uses
those insights to determine what pragmas to use, where to use them, and with
what parameters in order to achieve the most optimal implementation possible.
Moreover, SLX FPGA can keep track of resource consumption as it explores
the vast design space to keep the final implementation within the constraints
specified by the designer.
SLX FPGA has been augmented to detect opportunities for performing loop
interchange transformations. When it determines that a particular loop nest
would result in better performance by interchanging loops, it inserts the
necessary directives in the code to direct the SLX Plugin to perform the
transformation. The tool flow is depicted in the figure below.

SLX FPGA Project
----------------

SLX FPGA version 2020.4 contains the SLX Plugin installed along with its
other tool binaries and libraries.
No additional setup steps are required to combine SLX FPGA and the SLX
Plugin.
Open the SLX FPGA GUI following the usual procedure and the tool
will already be aware of the plugin (restricted to supported versions).

.. attention::
   
   The SLX Plugin is only supported in SLX FPGA 2020.4 for Ubuntu 18.04
   host machines.

The SLX FPGA GUI allows enabling and disabling the SLX Plugin and the
corresponding loop interchange directives.
When enabled, SLX FPGA will then take care of generating and adapting
Tcl files, setting options, adding ``_SLXLoopInterchange`` to your source
files, and optimizing your design.

For more information about SLX FPGA, refer to the `SLX FPGA User Guide`_.
