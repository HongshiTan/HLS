Introduction
============

The SLX Plugin is a High-level Synthesis (HLS) compiler add-on for Vitis 2020.2
that helps improve HLS latency and throughput results.
Software developers and hardware designers can achieve better results for a
set of common design styles and application types with the plugin.
When enabled, the plugin augments Vitis HLS' code transformations and adds an
additional synthesis directive that helps to squeeze out performance.

      SLX Plugin for Vitis HLS - Overview

The figure shows how the SLX Plugin directly extends the HLS process for
Vitis HLS in two ways.
The new synthesis directive, namely ``_SLXLoopInterchange``, can be applied to
a system of nested loops for performing a loop interchange.
Loop interchange exchanges the loop nest iteration variables,
effectively interchanging the iteration order in the loop nest.
``_SLXLoopInterchange`` can be used alone or in combination with other
Vitis HLS synthesis directives and constraints to achieve reduced latency and
increased throughput. Interchanging iteration orders helps with reordering
dependencies that block parallelism, pipelining and memory access patterns.
``_SLXLoopInterchange`` is described in the :ref:`interchange` chapter.

The SLX Plugin can be used as a pure standalone addition to Vitis HLS.
This way, ``_SLXLoopInterchange`` directives can be manually inserted into the
source code like any other Vitis HLS directive.
In the :ref:`quick` chapter, we will walk you through the steps to use the
SLX Plugin.

As with any other HLS directives and optimization settings, careful analysis
is required to determine optimal use of ``_SLXLoopInterchange``. To this end,
Silexica's standalone `SLX FPGA`_ tool can provide tremendous assistance when
it comes to optimizing directive use for HLS designs. SLX FPGA makes use of
dynamic analysis data and fast performance models to perform automated design
space exploration. It enables designers to identify the optimal directives
settings for any given set of resource constraints. In addition, its analysis
capabilities provide deep insights into the code and data movement to help
guide designers whenever code refactoring is necessary.
The upcoming version of SLX FPGA, SLX FPGA 2020.4, has been extended to also
analyze designs for opportunities to apply the ``_SLXLoopInterchange``
directive whenever it deems that performance will improve as a result.
This allows using SLX FPGA, the SLX Plugin and Vitis HLS together for
attaining an improved HLS development methodology.
See the how to :ref:`slxfpga-chap` chapter for more information.

Finally, the SLX plugin also provides a few automatic compiler transformations
that complement transformations performed by Vitis HLS.
In certain key scenarios, an HLS design's internal program representation can
be improved, leading to improved HLS design performance. These transformations
are collectively called IR design optimizations. They are described
in the :ref:`tidy-up` chapter of this user guide.
